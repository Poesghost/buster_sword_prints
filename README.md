# Buster Sword

## About

The model was built from the ground up using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), exported as a `.stl` file, imported into [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/), sliced and the result is saved as a `.gcode` file. This print was designed around it being printed on both the Prusa Mini+ and Ender 5 Plus.

Version 2 will be making it so you can print all the parts on a Prusa Mini+ only.

> **_IMPORTANT:_** It is never recommended to print from someone elses gcode file. That is why I included the `.stl` files in this repo. I recommend you use the stl files in your slicer of choice to re-create the `.gcode` file.

There is a slit for a metal sheet between blades 1 and 2. I am working on a body harness and the metal sheet embeded in the sword will allow it to attach to a persons back using an electromagnet.
